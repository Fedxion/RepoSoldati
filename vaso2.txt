Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you)

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothin' to say
And everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh, oh, oh

In this world, it's just usCotillon
